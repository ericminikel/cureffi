<blockquote><p>Some of the potential areas of discussion are:</p>
<p><strong>I. Mechanism of mutation effects</strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">A. Protein level</span></p>
<p>eg what are the effects of the mutation polymorphism combination on the protein<br/>
Conformation(s)<br/>
Interaction(s)<br/>
Localization(s)<br/>
Degradation(s)<br/>
What are the lessons from the other mutant PRNPs?</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">B. Cell level</span><br/>
Pathways that lead to PRNP folding in general<br/>
Pathways that lead to mutant PRNP folding/misfolding in specific<br/>
Pathways that lead to differential protein synthesis<br/>
Pathways that lead to differential protein degradation</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">C. Organ/System level</span></p>
<p>Is there a true premorbid/early disturbance in sleep cycle?<br/>
Are there any SQUID/PET/NMR modes that detect activity or tissue state<br/>
differences early?<br/>
Mechanisms for biomarker generation and therapeutic agent effects<br/>
monitoring options<br/>
Discovering measures to assess modifier/therapeutic effects in short term<br/>
mouse model / patient</p>
<p>Are there factors/agents that alter any of the above?<br/>
Effects from other genetic variations?<br/>
Could one use variant genetic backgrounds or genetic screens to test for this?<br/>
Mouse model over variant genetics (especially with protein-based transmission?)<br/>
Drosophila model a possibility for suppressor screen?<br/>
Any similarity to glutamine repeat expansion mechanisms?<br/>
Effects of aging?  Continuous or accelerative?<br/>
Effects of hormones, drugs, or medications?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>II. Screening platforms</strong></p>
<p>Given any of that, are there any clues to guide/prioritize experimental<br/>
plan for screening?</p>
<p>What are the potential kinds of screening platforms for evaluating<br/>
therapeutic agents?</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">A.  Mouse model</span><br/>
Transgenic mutation<br/>
Purified protein injection<br/>
Transplant</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> B. Cell model</span><br/>
Cells from the mouse<br/>
Cells from people</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> C. Purified protein model</span><br/>
Mutant vs. wildtype protein<br/>
structure prediction</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> D. Small molecule docking</span><br/>
drug library binding assays and technologies</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>III. What are potential classes of candidate therapeutic agents?</strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">A. Therapeutics targeting the mutant</span><br/>
gene<br/>
mRNA<br/>
protein</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">B. Therapeutics that more generally address or modify</span><br/>
protein folding machinery<br/>
protein degradation machinery<br/>
Other host pathways<br/>
protein synthesis<br/>
Protein degradation/autophagy<br/>
Systemic / localized inflammation<br/>
Effects of circadian patterns<br/>
Growth control (protein synthesis and turnover)<br/>
<strong></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>IV. Very simple agents/and strategies to consider having at least a potentially helpful role</strong></p>
<p>Anti-inflammatory agents<br/>
Anti-growth agents, eg: promoting autophagy<br/>
Mild pathway modulators, eg: vitamin D, E, flavins, curcumin etc (lessons from mother&#8217;s course relative to others?)<br/>
Stronger pathway effectors, eg: Sirolomus, Everolimus, EGFR inhibitors<br/>
Biological therapies?</p>
<p>Bone marrow transplantation to suppress disease progression via glial cell replacement?</p>
<p>Making stem cells from patients?</p>
<p>Best platforms for evaluating potentially therapeutic oligos to suppress mutant protein synthesis? Where exactly in the cell is the protein synthesized?  Is there trans-cellular protein trafficking and turnover?</p></blockquote>
