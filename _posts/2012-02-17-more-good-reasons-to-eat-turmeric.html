<div>Background</div>
<div id="__p1">Microglial cells are important effectors of the neuronal innate immune system with a major role in chronic neurodegenerative diseases. Curcumin, a major component of tumeric, alleviates pro-inflammatory activities of these cells by inhibiting nuclear factor kappa B (NFkB) signaling. To study the immuno-modulatory effects of curcumin on a transcriptomic level, DNA-microarray analyses were performed with resting and LPS-challenged microglial cells after short-term treatment with curcumin.</div>

<div>Results</div>
<div id="__p3"><strong>Curcumin treatment markedly changed the microglial transcriptome</strong> with 49 differentially expressed transcripts in a combined analysis of resting and activated microglial cells. Curcumin effectively<strong> triggered anti-inflammatory signals</strong> as shown by induced expression of <em>Interleukin 4 </em>and <em>Peroxisome proliferator activated receptor Î±</em>. Several novel curcumin-induced genes including <em>Netrin G1</em>, <em>Delta-like 1</em>, <em>Platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule 1</em>, and <em>Plasma cell endoplasmic reticulum protein 1</em>, have been previously associated with adhesion and cell migration. Consequently, curcumin treatment significantly inhibited basal and activation-induced migration of BV-2 microglia. Curcumin also<strong> potently blocked gene expression related to pro-inflammatory activation of resting cells</strong> including <em>Toll-like receptor 2 </em>and <em>Prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2</em>. Moreover, transcription of <em>NO synthase 2 </em>and <em>Signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 </em>was reduced in LPS-triggered microglia. These transcriptional changes in curcumin-treated LPS-primed microglia also<strong> lead to decreased neurotoxicity</strong> with reduced apoptosis of 661W photoreceptor cultures.</div>

<div>Conclusions</div>
<div id="__p4">Collectively, our results suggest that curcumin is a potent modulator of the microglial transcriptome. <strong>Curcumin attenuates microglial migration and triggers a phenotype with anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective propertie</strong>s. Thus, curcumin could be a nutraceutical compound to develop immuno-modulatory and neuroprotective therapies for the treatment of various neurodegenerative disorders.</div>
