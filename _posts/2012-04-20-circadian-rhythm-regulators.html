<p>I haven&#8217;t had time to look in any detail, but two papers in Nature last month address nuclear receptors involved in regulation of circadian behavior, and one proposes synthetic agonists against these receptors as potential treatment for sleep and metabolic disorders.</p>

<p>Proposed factors of importance in this mechanism seem to include: BMAL1, REV-ERB-α and REV-ERB-β, PER, and CRY.  I wonder if any of these are misregulated in FFI?</p>
