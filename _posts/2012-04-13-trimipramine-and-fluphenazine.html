<p>@s just noticed today this study from late 2011.  Thomas Wisniewski&#8217;s lab at NYU tested two already FDA-approved drugs, trimiprimine (an antidepressant) and fluphenazine (an antipsychotic) in mice and found significant delays (about 20%) in disease onset as well as reduction in severity.     Since they&#8217;re both psychiatric-indicated drugs, they obviously both know how to cross the blood-brain barrier.  The mouse model was scrapie mice infected via intraperitoneal injection.</p>
<p>The study in PLoS ONE:</p>
