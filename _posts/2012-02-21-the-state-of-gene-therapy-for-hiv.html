<p>We&#8217;ve heard a lot lately about recent advances in gene therapy driven by the search for new vaccine-like treatments for HIV.  At an MIT Enterprise Forum event earlier this month, <a href="http://arep.med.harvard.edu/gmc/">George Church</a> raised this as an example of the type of treatment he thinks will become more common in the future for diseases we are unable to treat with small molecule drugs.</p>
<p>From what I can find online it seems that there are two approaches currently being tested in humans for HIV.</p>
<p>One approach, <a href="http://news.sciencemag.org/sciencenow/2011/09/gene-therapy-may-thwart-hiv.html">described here in Science</a>, is to <em>disable</em> the gene for the CCR5 receptor on T cells so that HIV is unable to attach to those cells.  This involves first removing the cells from the patient&#8217;s body, mutating them and then transfusing them back in:</p>
<blockquote><p>The trial participants had T cells removed from their blood and then modified in the laboratory with a designer enzyme engineered by Sangamo BioSciences in Richmond, California. The enzyme, called a zinc finger nuclease, clips the gene for the CCR5 receptor and disables it. Ten billion modified cells were then reinfused into the participants&#8217; bodies, and the new data show that about 25% of cells had the mutant CCR5s.</p></blockquote>
<p>The other approach, described in both an <a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v481/n7379/full/nature10660.html">article</a> and a <a href="http://www.nature.com/news/gene-therapy-can-protect-against-hiv-1.9516">press release</a> in Nature, is to <em>add</em> a gene for an HIV antibody to a hypothetical patient&#8217;s genome by means of an adenovirus.  I say hypothetical because this approach has not yet reached human trials:</p>
<blockquote><p>We show that humanized mice receiving VIP appear to be fully protected from HIV infection, even when challenged intravenously with very high doses of replication-competent virus. Our results suggest that successful translation of this approach to humans may produce effective prophylaxis against HIV.</p></blockquote>
<p>It seems both of these approaches are still a ways off from being useful for heritable prion diseases, for a couple of reasons.  We&#8217;ve not yet invented an antibody that works against misfolded prion proteins, and to my knowledge we also aren&#8217;t totally certain that people can live healthily without PrP, so neither adding or deleting genes is quite an option yet.  There is also the issue of drug delivery: we can&#8217;t remove neurons and astrocytes from the body in order to delete a gene, and any virus we&#8217;d inject to deliver a gene would need to be able to cross the blood-brain barrier.  Still, it is heartening that gene therapy is moving along so quickly: while details remain to be worked out, this is in principle a potential treatment route for any genetic disease.</p>
