<p>I spent some time looking for the PRNP and trying to understand its mysteries.  Even though PrP is 209 amino acids (253 pre-translation, which is what the codon numberings are based on), the PRNP gene <a title="PRNP on Ensembl" href="http://useast.ensembl.org/Homo_sapiens/Location/View?g=ENSG00000171867;r=20:4666882-4682236">clocks in at 15.36 kb</a>.  So when I first saw it, I wondered, what IS all that other stuff?  <a title="Ensembl - PRNP Gene Summary" href="http://useast.ensembl.org/Homo_sapiens/Gene/Summary?db=core;g=ENSG00000171867;r=20:4666882-4682236">Ensembl&#8217;s gene summary</a> with its list of five &#8220;transcripts&#8221; didn&#8217;t help me that much.  There are two 253-aa protein coding sequences listed, which both point to <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/CCDS/CcdsBrowse.cgi?REQUEST=CCDS&amp;DATA=CCDS13080">the same link</a>, which I looked at a bit.  It looks mostly right as a reference sequence&#8211; 127G, 178D, 219E&#8211; although it&#8217;s a bit weird in that it lists codon 129 as Y (Tyrosine), not a genotype I&#8217;ve ever heard of.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/NG_009087.1">NCBI&#8217;s page on PRNP</a> was a bit more helpful &#8212; it actually lists the different components of the PRNP gene with a bit of description of each.  If you scroll down to CDS, that appears to be the one of interest since it is described as:</p>
<blockquote><p>
prion-related protein; major prion protein; CD230 antigen; prion protein PrP; prion protein (p27-30) (Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, Gerstmann-Strausler-Scheinker syndrome, fatal familial insomnia)
</p></blockquote>
<p>And if you click the CDS link, it highlights the DNA sequence that generates PrP.</p>
<p>Question: so what are the other 15.36 kb?  Is any of that other stuff transcribed or translated?  Is there any alternative splicing or is PrP the one and only product of PRNP?</p>
