---

Sonia and I have launched our own lab at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, based in the Stanley Center and interacting closely with Stuart Schreiber's group. We are proud to announce that we now have two new job positions open in our lab. Our mission is to develop drugs for prion disease in our lifetime, and our work spans *in vivo* therapeutic studies, genetics, biomarkers, natural history, and forging clinical and regulatory pathways for new drugs. We are currently a team of three (us and one Research Scientist) and are now looking to grow our group to five. This is your opportunity to join a mission-driven lab led by a [patient-scientist team](https://www.wired.com/story/sleep-no-more-crusade-genetic-killer/), bent on making an immediate difference in human health.

We are now accepting applications for these two positions:

[**Postdoctoral associate**](https://g.co/kgs/JLT7RB): seeking a self-starting, translationally-minded scientist to lead multiple projects, principally revolving around *in vivo* studies of therapeutics in rodents. A Ph.D. in molecular biology or similar is desired. You will co-supervise a research associate (see below) to help you on your projects.

[**Research associate**](https://g.co/kgs/9oG9qH): seeking a B.S. in molecular biology or related field with laboratory experience, preferably in one or more relevant techniques (see posting for details), to work closely with the postdoctoral associate (see above) as well as us and our Research Scientist.

Please send a CV and cover letter through the official application links above. We look forward to hearing from you!
