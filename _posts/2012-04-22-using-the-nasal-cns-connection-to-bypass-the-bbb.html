<p>Apparently the nasal-CNS connection can sometimes allow drugs administered as nasal drops or sprays to bypass the blood-brain barrier and access the brain directly. Â  In this case a Japanese team was able to get methotrexate (a non-BBB crossing antitumor agent) to the brains of rats by taking advantage of what they term &#8220;nose-brain direct transport.&#8221;</p>
