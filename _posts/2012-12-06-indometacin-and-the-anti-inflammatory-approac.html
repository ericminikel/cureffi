<p>A quick post on two slightly-related topics: indometacin and inflammation in prion disease.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/manueldis-1998-dapsone-to-delay-symptoms-in-cjd-.pdf">Manueldis 1998</a>, who I&#8217;ve mentioned previously in the dapsone post, also tested <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indometacin">indometacin</a>, another anti-inflammatory drug.  Manueldis found a very small (probably about 5%, judging by Fig 1) delay in symptom onset in rats treated with indometacin, but no significant delay in death.</p>
<p>As far as I can tell, Manueldis was the only one to test indometacin in an animal model, but <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11792368">Veerhuis 2002</a> tested it in a cell culture model.  Microglia are activated in prion disease, and secrete &#8220;neurotoxic agents&#8221; and IL-1 and IL-6 in response to contact with neurotoxic fragments of PrP.  This study examined how microglia respond to PrP synthetic fragments (release of TNF-Alpha, IL-1, PGE(2)) and whether indometacin would inhibit microglial activation and reduce toxicity.  It didn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>There has been a lot of other work on inflammation in prion diseases over the years, more than I can wrap my head around.  The topic has gotten a lot of press just recently with <a href="http://www.biomedcentral.com/content/pdf/1752-0509-6-132.pdf">Crespo 2012</a>&#8216;s claim that inflammation is a central part of the neurodegeneration process in prion disease, capable of creating a &#8220;self-maintained disease state&#8221;.  This paper is pure computational biology, a network analysis of genes that are differentially expressed during prion infection.  It should hardly be surprising that inflammation-related genes are differentially expressed during a disease that leads to inflammation, but the authors&#8217; claim is stronger than that: they argue that a few core genes involved in inflammation lie at the center of this network, regulating each other to keep disease going:</p>
<blockquote><p>What we consider remarkable and constitutes our main finding is the key role that neuroinflammation plays in the specific case of prion disease, connecting different functional modules and constituting a switch that allows the network to reach a self-maintained disease state, once triggering factors (protein deposition and the formation of amyloid plaques) initiate the process.</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;m not sufficiently well-read on the inflammation-and-prions literature to have a <em>very</em> strong opinion on this, but I feel that the conclusion is worded a bit more strongly than the evidence merits.   Inflammation is certainly a feature of prion disease, and it could well be one contributor to disease pathology.  Still, the conclusion that inflammation leads to a &#8220;self-maintained disease state&#8221; seems to go a bit far.  I&#8217;m open to being proven wrong &#8211; the authors state they plan to test their hypothesis by looking at whether mice with one of these core genes knocked out have a different reaction to prion infection.  But considering the evidence we have now, the role of inflammation seems much more marginal and/or downstream.  There is better evidence for the possibility of anti-inflammatories as Alzheimer&#8217;s therapeutics, and that has inspired a number of studies of anti-inflammatory drugs in scrapie mice&#8211;<a title="Adverse effects of ibuprofen" href="/2012/12/01/adverse-effects-of-ibuprofen/">ibuprofen</a>, <a title="Dapsone" href="/2012/11/29/dapsone/">dapsone</a> and indometacin&#8211; none of which have been extremely successful.  <a title="Statins as prion therapeutics" href="/2012/09/28/statins-as-prion-therapeutics/">Statin fanatics like Dr. Agus</a> will point out that statins also reduce inflammation in the long term.   Arguably this could be another possible explanation for the consistent finding of a small but significant delay in prion disease onset in mice treated with statins.  But remember that statin treatment didn&#8217;t reduce PrP<sup>Sc</sup> accumulation, it just allowed the mice to tolerate greater neurological insult before succumbing to symptoms and death.  Overall, I could be more easily convinced that inflammation has <em>some</em> role in the presentation of symptoms and less easily convinced that it lies at the core of the disease process.</p>
