<p>Below is the website for the 9<sup>th</sup> Annual CJD Foundation Family Conference, held July 8-10, 2011 in Washington DC.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.neuroprion.org/en/patients-event-9th-CJD-Conf.html">http://www.neuroprion.org/en/patients-event-9th-CJD-Conf.html</a></p>
<p>The site contains an archive of video and powerpoint materials from all of the presentations given at the 2011 conference, as well as links to the equivalent sites for the past several conferences.</p>

<p>The videos are well-organized and curated.  Many are divided into titled chapters to allow for targeted viewing.</p>
<p>Below is a list of the 2011 speakers and topics.  I plan to post separately on the 7/9/11 presentation by Gianluigi Forloni which is especially on-point for FFI.  Dr. Forloni studies the therapeutic effects of doxycycline in symptomatic CJD patients and, as of 2011, is beginning a long-term study looking at the efficacy of doxycycline in pre-symptomatic FFI mutation carriers.</p>
