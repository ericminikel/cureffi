<p>The Internet is awfully excited about luminescent conjugated polymers!  &#8220;<a title="Alpha galileo luminescent conjugated polymers" href="http://www.alphagalileo.org/ViewItem.aspx?ItemId=119583&amp;CultureCode=en">Prions eliminated</a>,&#8221; they say.  &#8220;<a title="Popsci luminescent conjugated polymers" href="http://m.popsci.com/science/article/2012-04/targeted-polymer-molecules-can-hunt-down-prions-brain">First treatment for prion-based disease</a>.&#8221;</p>
<p>While that may be premature, LCPs have apparently been shown to decrease infectivity of prion-infected brain slices, and to decrease concentration of PrP(Sc) oligomers in an avidity assay.  They seem to do this by <em>stabilizing</em> PrP aggregates &#8212; perhaps so toxic oligomers are less likely to break off?  Authors include Adriano Aguzzi, among others.</p>
<p>Still working on understanding what a luminescent conjugated polymer<em> is </em>and how it works.  Abstract from the paper, published on April 6th, <a title="Polythiophenes inhibit prion propagation by stabilizing PrP aggregates" href="http://www.jbc.org/content/early/2012/04/06/jbc.M112.355958.abstract?sid=6130f2be-b815-43c0-a811-7eeba4bf0fb4http://">here </a>and below.</p>

<p id="p-1"><strong>Background:</strong> Luminescent conjugated polymers (LCPs) are highly specific to amyloid conformations and may represent potential antiprion compounds.</p>
<p id="p-2"><strong>Results:</strong> LCPs significantly reduce prion titers, while rendering PrP<sup>Sc</sup> more stable to proteolytic digestion.</p>
<p id="p-3"><strong>Conclusion:</strong> LCPs possess pronounced antiprion potential and appear to act by compaction of frangible fibers.</p>
<p id="p-4"><strong>Significance:</strong> LCPs may represent novel pharmacophores for the prevention and treatment of prion diseases.</p>

<blockquote>
<p id="p-5">LCPs interact with ordered protein aggregates and sensitively detect amyloids of many different proteins, suggesting that they may possess antiprion properties. Here we show that a variety of anionic, cationic and zwitterionic LCPs reduced the infectivity of prion-containing brain homogenates and of prion-infected cerebellar organotypic cultured slices COCS, and decreased the amount of PrP<sup>Sc</sup> oligomers that could be captured in an avidity assay. Paradoxically, treatment enhanced the resistance of PrP<sup>Sc</sup> to proteolysis, and triggered the compaction and enhanced the resistance to proteolysis of recombinant mPrP<sub>23-231</sub> fibers. These results suggest that LCPs act as antiprion agents by transitioning PrP aggregates into structures with reduced frangibility. Moreover, ELISA on COCS and in vitro conversion assays with mPrP<sub>23-231</sub> indicated that PTAA may additionally interfere with the generation of PrP<sup>Sc</sup> by stabilizing the conformation of PrP<sup>C</sup> or of a transition intermediate. Therefore, LCPs represent a novel class of antiprion agents whose mode of action appears to rely on hyperstabilization, rather than destabilization, of PrP<sup>Sc</sup> deposits.</p>
