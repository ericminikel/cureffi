<p>Memantine (above) represents one possible prion therapeutic.  <a href="http://vir.sgmjournals.org/content/89/2/594.full">Riemer 2008</a> tested five different drugs in scrapie-infected mice, the other four of which I&#8217;ve already discussed in other posts: <a title="Adverse effects of ibuprofen" href="/2012/12/01/adverse-effects-of-ibuprofen/">ibuprofen</a>, <a title="Dapsone" href="/2012/11/29/dapsone/">dapsone</a>, <a title="More about minocycline" href="/2012/11/26/more-about-minocycline/">minocycline</a>, and <a title="Curcumin as prion therapeutic" href="/2012/11/24/curcumin-as-prion-therapeutic/">curcumin</a>.  But of all the drugs Riemer tested, memantine looked the most promising, as seen in the <a href="http://vir.sgmjournals.org/content/89/2/594/T1.expansion.html">summary table</a>.</p>
<p>Memantine was first synthesized way back in 1968, though like most drugs that act on the central nervous system, we didn&#8217;t actually know how it worked yet.  For an accessible and well-written review and history of the drug, see <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC534915/">Lipton 2004</a>.  In the 1990s memantine was discovered to be a weak <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NMDA_receptor">NMDA receptor</a> antagonist, meaning it inhibits excitatory glutamatergic signaling in the brain.  I say &#8220;weak&#8221; to mean that it&#8217;s not like one of these  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetrodotoxin">pufferfish poisons</a> that binds to an ion channel so strongly that it prevents the nerve from functioning and kills you.</p>
<p>Indeed, the &#8220;weakness&#8221; of memantine as an NMDA antagonist is why it&#8217;s useful.  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excitotoxicity">Excitotoxicity</a> is part of the pathology (though not an underlying cause) of many neurodegenerative diseases including Huntington&#8217;s and Alzheimer&#8217;s, and Lipton explains why memantine can reduce this excitotoxicity without preventing normal synapse function: memantine is &#8220;an uncompetitive open-channel blocker with a dwell time/off-rate from the channel that limited pathological activity of the NMDA receptor while sparing normal synaptic activity&#8221;.  So the hope is that, while memantine may not prevent an accumulation of misfolded proteins that underlies neurodegenerative disease, it can help spare neurons from death by overstimulation.</p>
<p>And apparently there is some good evidence of an effect in Alzheimer&#8217;s disease, though mostly in moderate to severe cases and not as much as a preventative measure or a treatment for mild cases.  For a trial in a couple hundred Alzheimer&#8217;s patients see <a href="http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa013128#t=article">Reisberg 2003</a>.</p>
<p>There is some evidence of a role of excitotoxicity in prion disease as well &#8211; Riemer cites <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9369987">Scallet &amp; Ye 1997</a>.  For some more recent work see <a href="http://jcb.rupress.org/content/181/3/407.full">Steele 2008</a>.  Steele thinks that part of PrP&#8217;s native function is to dampen NMDA signaling.  His argument rests heavily on <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2364707/">Khosravani 2008</a>&#8216;s experiments showing increased NMDA signaling in neurons from PrP-null mice.  If true, this story would jive with evidence that PrP knockout mice may have increased susceptibility to seizures [<a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1528-1157.1999.tb01583.x/pdf">Walz 1999</a>].   Concluding, Steele speculates about implications for pathology in prion disease &#8211; is a partial loss of function of PrP, leading to toxic levels of NMDA signaling, part of the pathogenic process?  We don&#8217;t really know yet.</p>
<p>But promisingly, Riemer finds a small but highly significant delay in onset of symptoms in scrapie-infected mice treated with memantine.  These mice were infected intracerebrally with 10<sup>-3</sup> brain homogenate of 139A prions and they were treated with the drugs orally, and not until 100 days post-infection (dpi).  All this makes for a powerful mouse model: if a molecule works in this model, you can be quite sure that it reaches the brain, acts in the brain, and is effective against a well-established prion infection.</p>
<p>Mice treated with memantine lived to 196±11.7 dpi compared to 181±7.2 for controls (n=8 in each group), an 8% delay in onset (p &lt; .01).</p>
<p>The mice received 30 mg/kg/day of memantine.  Riemer cites <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16580645">Jin 2006</a>, an Alzheimer&#8217;s mouse study, as the basis fro this dose.    It&#8217;s equivalent to 30 * <a href="http://www.fasebj.org/content/22/3/659/T1.expansion.html">3/37</a> * 70 = 170 mg/day for a 70 kg person.  That&#8217;s a pretty enormous dose: <a href="http://reference.medscape.com/drug/namenda-xr-memantine-343063">according to Medscape</a>, the indicated dose for Alzheimer&#8217;s in people is 28 mg/day, and even that you have to build up to, starting at 7 mg/day; <a href="http://www.drugs.com/dosage/memantine.html">drugs.com</a> disagrees, recommending no more than 20 mg/day.  At least it looks like <a href="http://reference.medscape.com/drug/namenda-xr-memantine-343063#4">adverse effects</a> of memantine are not too common or devastating.</p>
<p>The patent status of memantine (commercially, Namenda) is a bit confusing.  The original patent from the 1960s is long gone, but it appears that no generics are available in the U.S.  Duncan Curley has an <a href="http://www.genericsweb.com/index.php?object_id=742">article on GenericsWeb</a> discussing the controversy over &#8220;new rights for old drugs&#8221; and whether memantine can legally be patented for new indications even though the molecule is not new.  Curley&#8217;s discussion focuses on Europe; I can&#8217;t find any good references on the U.S. legal status.  <a href="http://alzheimers.emedtv.com/namenda/generic-namenda.html">MedTV claims</a> that the patent will expire in 2015 but has no citations for this.  If anyone has a better source of information on this, let me know.</p>
