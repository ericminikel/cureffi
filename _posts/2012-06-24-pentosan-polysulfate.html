<p><strong>update 2013-01-31: this post has been deprecated; please see <a title="The rise and fall of pentosan polysulfate in prion disease" href="/2012/12/13/the-rise-and-fall-of-pentosan-polysulfate-in-prion-disease/">The rise and fall of pentosan polysulfate in prion disease</a> for a more complete treatment of the subject.</strong></p>
<p>Another potential therapeutic which has been studied, of which we learned only recently, is<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentosan_polysulfate"> pentosan polysulfate</a>, originally approved for treating interstitial cystitis of the bladder.  This garnered a lot of attention in the early 2000s and made it further than anything besides quinacrine and doxycycline have done&#8211; it was administered to <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19788637">11 patients in Japan</a> and at least <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1513442/">7 in the UK</a>, and has led to some patients living quite a long time&#8211; <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/4306351.stm">BBC reports</a> on one person living with vCJD for at least three years under treatment with pentosan polysulfate.  Though there was never a clinical trial, this drug wound up being the subject of <a href="http://www.cjd.ed.ac.uk/bone.pdf">a rather extensive study by Dr. Ian Bone</a>, who seems to have concluded that the drug is not necessarily effective, results in some surgical complications, and did not merit much further study: &#8220;There are currently no prospective open dose-finding and efficacy (phase I/II) follow-up studies planned.&#8221;  Re: the surgical complications, the drug doesn&#8217;t cross the blood-brain barrier, so it was administered using an intraventricular catheter, meaning a hole was drilled in the patient&#8217;s skull and the drug was dripped in continuously.  Predictably this seems to have resulted in a lot of serious infections.</p>
<p>In spite of all this, <a href="http://www.prion.ucl.ac.uk/clinic-services/research/drug-treatments/">the UK&#8217;s MRC Prion Unit till lists pentosan polysulfate</a> as one of its potential drug treatments for prion disease, and <a href="http://www.bene-pharmachem.de/en/research/prion.php">bene pharmaChem</a>, which owns the drug, still promotes prion disease as a potential application for the drug.  The most recent paper I could find <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1440-1789.2011.01245.x/abstract">[Honda 2011]</a>, published in Neuropathology, dissects brains of patients treated with the drug and did not seem to find any clear signs of what the drug had achieved.</p>
