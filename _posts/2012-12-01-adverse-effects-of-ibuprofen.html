<p><a href="http://vir.sgmjournals.org/content/89/2/594.full">Riemer 2008</a> has provided, to our knowledge, the only study so far looking at ibuprofen as a potential prion therapeutic.  The mice suffered pretty severe adverse effects.</p>
<p>In choosing ibuprofen as a candidate compound, Riemer was presumably inspired by <a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/content/20/15/5709.full">Lim 2001</a>, who examined ibuprofen in a genetic Alzheimer&#8217;s mouse model and found that ibuprofen reduced the levels of the classic markers of Alzheimer&#8217;s pathology: IL-1β, GFAP, Aβ plaques.  (Riemer cites Lim but does not actually discuss the reasons for the choice of ibuprofen).  Lim in turn was inspired by evidence from <a href="http://www.neurology.org/content/48/3/626.full">Stewart 1997</a>, a longitudinal observational study of ~1700 Americans which found a reduced relative risk of Alzheimer&#8217;s among people who took <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-steroidal_anti-inflammatory_drug">NSAIDs</a> (such as ibuprofen) for at least than 2 years.</p>
<p>In prion disease, though, Riemer found it impossible to even tell if ibuprofen would have had an effect on the disease course, because the adverse effects were so pronounced:</p>
<blockquote><p>Scrapie-infected ibuprofen-treated mice developed large erythema, followed by ulcerations of the outer genital region and massively enlarged urinary bladders (data not shown). About half of the ibuprofen-receiving mice had to be sacrificed due to their poor condition before they displayed typical symptoms of a late-stage scrapie infection. Uninfected ibuprofen-treated mice remained completely normal, indicating that the combination of drug treatment and ongoing prion disease development triggered these adverse responses.</p></blockquote>
<p>Some amount of bladder enlargement is associated with scrapie infection in mice generally, and one study [<a href="/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/guenther-2001-early-behavioural-changes-in-scrapie-affected-mice-and-the-influence-of-dapsone.pdf">Guenther 2001</a>] also found a worsening of this effect with <a href="/2012/11/29/dapsone/">dapsone</a>.  But it sounds as though the adverse effect was much more pronounced with ibuprofen.</p>
<p>The dose of ibuprofen used for the mice was 100 mg/kg/day, equivalent to 100 mg/kg * <a href="http://www.fasebj.org/content/22/3/659/T1.expansion.html">3/37</a> * 70 kg = 567 mg/day for a 70 kg person, well within <a href="http://www.drugs.com/dosage/ibuprofen.html">the range</a> people take.</p>
