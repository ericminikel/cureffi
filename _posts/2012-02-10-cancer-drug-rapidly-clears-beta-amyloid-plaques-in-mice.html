<p>A new study published in <em>Science</em> describes the success of a cancer drug in clearing beta-amyloid plaques in murine models.</p>
<p>The job of removing beta-amyloid is performed by the enzyme apolipoprotein E (ApoE).  In people with a variant of this enzyme, beta-amyloid may stop being removed effectively.  People with the ApoE4 variant in paritcular are at higher risk of this happening and consequently developing Alzheimer&#8217;s disease.</p>
<p>A few questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Can this drug work for misfolded PrP plaques?</li>
<li>Is there an enzyme that clears away PrP equivalently?</li>
<li>If such an enzyme exists, when and why does it clear PrP away?  Does it normally clear misfolded PrP away only?  Does PrP misfold on occasion normally?</li>
<li>If such an enzyme exists, can a variant in the enzyme make a patient immune to misfolded PrP?  Could some people, such as kuru survivors, have such a variant?</li>
</ul>
<p>Studying the role and lifecycle of PrP is a good funding target.  What information is out there already?</p>
<p>Along these lines of thinking, it would be great if we could get access to a genomic database and start looking for variations in PrP among the population, variations in the genomes of kuru survivors, and variations in the genome of people at the PrP-clearing enzyme (if it exists).</p>
