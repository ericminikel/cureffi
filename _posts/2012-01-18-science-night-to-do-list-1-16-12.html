<p><strong>Short term:</strong></p>
<p>1. Known ffi sufferers who had had their tonsils and/or spleen out? (s)</p>
<p>2. Pursue data on human FFI sufferers (e)</p>
<p>3. Learn more about david baker @ uw-seattle &#8211; ab initio protein structure prediction (e)</p>
<p>rosetta algorithm &#8211; has won several critical assessment of structure prediction competitions/ CASP</p>
<p>rosetta@home &#8211; you can work on predicting protein structure at home</p>
<p>4. Schedule meeting with contact at the Lindquist lab (3)</p>
<p>5. Register a new email address and put it on the web page (e – done)</p>
<p>6. Watch videos from annual CJD conference about update on doxycycline trials in Europe (s)</p>
<p>7.  Learn more about attending annual CJD conference (s)</p>
<p>8. Find info about PrP(Sc) being proteinase-resistant/ detergent-insoluble and post to site (s)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Longer term:</strong></p>
<p>Potential experiments related to follicular dendritic cells in spleen:</p>
<p>Experiment 1: knock PrP out of follicular dendritic cells in spleen (which prevents vCJD) but</p>
<p>then introduce PrPsC into brain and see if mice still get it</p>
<p>Experiment 2: see if mice with spleen and tonsils out are susceptible to PrPSc/FFI</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Potential fundable research topic for a grad student:</p>
<p>Obtain a structure of the misfolded prion protein</p>
<p>Solve the structure of both versions of the protein in both states</p>
<p>Get an idea of the thermodynamic difference between the wildtype and mutant protein</p>
<p>and whether chaperones interact with them</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>To think more about:</strong></p>
<p>Nature of GPI anchor</p>
<p>Structure of PrP protein; proximity of mutation at D178N, disulfide bond at Cys179 and Cys214, and glycosylation at Asn181 and Asn197</p>
<p>Does this disulfide bond change oxidation/reduction status in the event of misfolding?</p>
<p>What&#8217;s known about the redox state of the protein and its ability to convert?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
